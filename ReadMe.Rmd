Getting and Cleaning Data ReadMe
========================================================

The derived dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt' - this file

- 'X_final.txt': a file where the means of the original columns that included "mean", "Mean" or "std" for each Activity and Subject was organized.

- 'Codebook.Rmd' a decription of the values held in X_final.txt

Run_analysis.R performs the analysis required for this project
--------------------------------------------------------------

See the codebook for information on the original and derived dataset in more detail.

The dataset required for this project is created to be consistent with the instructions below with expanded descriptions provided for the specific implementation.  Comments are also provided in the "Run_analysis.R" file itself for each step.

* You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following
  - The resulting script is called "Run_analysis.R"
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - This was a cbind of the datasets
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  - Out of all features, only ones with "Mean" "mean" or "std" were preserved. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - The given activity names were added as a column
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - The given variable names were added to the dataset
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  - The mean of each type of activity for each subject was taken to aggregate/collapse the data
